## Hello world 👩🏽‍💻

I'm a Software Engineer focused on Front-end engineering and:

- ⚛️ I love Javascript and React
- 🌱 I’m currently learning learning Vue.js, Angular and some advanced frontend topics
- 💜 I really enjoy getting involved in voluntary causes that I identify with and mainly working with developer communities, at this moment I'm a community manager at: [@compiladoras](https://twitter.com/compiladoras), [@womenthatreact](https://twitter.com/womenthatreact) and [@mulheresnatecbs](https://twitter.com/mulheresnatecbs), they're all focused on support women in technology 💃
